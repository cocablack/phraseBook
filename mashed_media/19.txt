[Sam Smith:]
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand
But I still need love cause I'm just a man
These nights never seem to go to plan
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?

[Sam Smith:]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Mary J. Blige:]
Why am I so emotional?
No it's not a good look, gain some self control
And deep down I know this never works
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt

[Mary J. Blige:]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
Oh won't you stay with me?

[Sam Smith:]
Oh won't you stay with me?
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
But darling, stay with me

[Sam Smith (Mary J. Blige):]
Oh won't you stay with me?
(Won't you stay? Won't you stay?)
Cause you're all I need
This ain't love, it's clear to see
(This ain't love, no, no, no)
But darling, stay with me
