Sadness Is A Blessing

My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
My wounded rhymes make silent cries tonight
And I keep it like a burning(?)
I'm longing from a distance 

I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known 

Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl 

These scars of mine make wounded rhymes tonight
I dream of times when you were mine so I 
Can keep it like a haunting
Heart beating close to mine 

Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl 

I ranted, I pleaded, I beg him not to go
For sorrow, the only lover I've ever known
Every night I rant, I plead, I beg him not to go
Will sorrow be the only lover I can call my own? 

Sadness is a blessing
Sadness is a pearl
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl 
Sadness is my boyfriend
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
Oh, sadness I'm your girl
